                Documentation for the UWFTP Protocol
                ------------------------------------
                                by Rhys Weatherley, 1991.

1. INTRODUCTION

This document describes the protocol used for transmission of files between
the UW/PC communications program (version 2.00 and higher) and UNIX hosts.
The main "brains" of the protocol is in the UW/PC client program, putting as
little burden as possible on the UNIX-based UWFTP server, both in terms of
program complexity and machine load.

2. PROTOCOL STARTUP

When the server is run by the user on the UNIX host, it will send the character
sequence CTRL-A followed by '>' followed by 'F'.  This will instruct UW/PC
to begin a UWFTP session in the window the UWFTP server is executed within (or
Protocol 0 if the UW server is not running).  If the UWFTP server does not
receive a reply from UW/PC within one second it will send the sequence again,
and will continue to retry at one-second intervals.  It will stop trying
either when it receives a CTRL-X character (cancel) or the letter captial 'A'.
If the transfer is cancelled, the server will exit, otherwise it will send a
message of the form:

        "HHHHH  UWFTP server <host-name> started on <date>"

The five 'H' characters are present to provide some redundancy for error
correction purposes.  The message above is followed by a line-feed character,
optionally preceded by a carriage return character.  All characters except
for the initial 'H' characters and spaces are displayed by UW/PC as a welcome
message for the server.  No interpretation is placed on them.  Unlike the
Internet FTP program, UW/PC doesn't ask for the user's password because the
UWFTP server can only be run once the user has logged in, and so asking for
a password is redundant.

If the UWFTP server receives a CTRL-X character at any time then it will send
a number of line-feeds (and carriage returns) and then five 'X' characters
separated and followed by some more line-feeds and carriage returns.  The
server will then exit.

3. PACKET FORMAT

This section describes the packet format that is used to transmit information
between UW/PC and the UWFTP server running on the UNIX host.  Packets are
delimited by one or more line-feed or carriage return characters (or any
combination).  Each packet begins with the packet number and type, the
encoded packet length (excluding the header information) and a two-byte
checksum value.  The maximum packet size is 94 characters, excluding the
header information.  The character encoding used is similar to that used by
the Kermit protocol, but is not fully compatibile with Kermit.  The following
characters describe the packet types that can get send between the machines:

        R - Specifies a filename to be retrieved from the UNIX host.
            The host will send a 'B' type packet in response to the
            correct reception of this packet type.
        S - Specifies a filename to be opened to place data sent from
            to the UW/PC client into.  After acknowledgement, the client
            will send a 'B' type packet.
        B - Beginning of file transfer.  The server or client has begun
            a file transfer.  The next highest received packet number
            from the client or server is the first 'D' type data packet
            for the current transfer file.
        D - Data packet.  All of the bytes following the packet header
            are considered raw data to be placed in the output file.  All
            transformation between ASCII and BINARY data is done by UW/PC.
            Data packets will be re-sent at five-second intervals until
            acknowledgements are received.
        E - End of data packet.  This is sent by the server or client when
            all data packets have been transferred.  The packet will be
            re-sent at one-second intervals until an acknowledgement is
            received.
        K - Acknowledgement packet.  The data portion of the packet specifies
            the packet number being acknowledged.  The packet will be re-sent
            at one-second intervals until the next incoming packet is detected.
        C - Specifies a UNIX command to be run on the host machine with an
            empty standard input file and all standard output and standard
            error output is to be transmitted back to the UW/PC client using
            the data packets described above.  After acknowledgement, the
            host will send a 'B' packet and will start sending the accumulated
            output from the UNIX command.
