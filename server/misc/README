This directory contains three items that may be of interest:


	getopt.c	The AT&T version of the getopt() library
			routine (for command-line processing).  This
			version, to the best of my knowledge, was
			placed into the public domain by AT&T.

	
	macmouse.ml	A package for use with Gosling's EMACS
			which intreprets encoded mouse-down and
			mouse-up events within windows to perform
			various operations.

	macmouse.el	A similar macro package for GNU EMACS.

			Author: Gregory Lauer (glauer@bbn.arpa)


The two EMACS macro packages were developed for a previous version of
UW (version 2.10).  Since I (John Bruner) am not an EMACS user, I do
not know how well they will work with UW v4.2.
